# Arene
The prototype of a local multiplayer game on PC, built with Unity.

The game is simply about being the last survivor in an arena. To achieve this, before the battle, you can choose your spells from several available options, which you will assign to each key, thus creating your own combinations.

If you ever want to give it a try, note that you need to talk to the character in the middle (more than 2 people) to initiate the combat.

I'm not including any screenshots of the game here because it's not very interesting as nothing was yet designed for the visuals. Honestly, the game has significant hitbox and bug issues, but it was only meant for testing an idea.
